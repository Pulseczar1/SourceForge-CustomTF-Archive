==============
 Description:
==============
 Quake-Life is a QuakeC conversion of the core Half-Life 1 entities into a playable Quake mod.
All half-life monsters and weapons are replaced with Quake 1 entities, and various button and
trinkets are tweaked to be more "Quake-like". The goal of this mod if to allow modders to have
maps that are multi-compatable for half-life 1 and quake, and also adds the ability for Quake 1
users to play through half-life levels.

===============
 Installation:
===============
- Place the progs.dat into a folder named "quakelife"
To play Half-Life 1 or Half-Life Uplink Demo:
- Extract the contents of the "valve" folder into the quakelife folder
- To play the Uplink demo, set the server's map to "hldemo1"
- To play the Half-Life single-player game, start on map "c1a0" (c0a0 set not fully supported yet)
- To play the training levels, set the map to "t0a0"

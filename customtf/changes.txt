The following is a changelog for the Improve Prozac CustomTF Project
Changes represent everything added/removed/altered since Often released his code on the customtf.com website
Blame RjLan for the horribleness of this changelog

========================================================================
Bug Fixes:
========================================================================

- Grenades
	Grenades would stick and follow the player through a death and respawn if the grenade was primed 0.8 seconds before the player died and respawned. Primed grenades are now always dropped when you die. -Randomer

- Tranquilizer
	The tranquilizer gun could not be selected if the player had no shells, even though the tranquilizer gun uses nails. You now only need nails to select the tranquilizer gun. -Randomer

- Camera/Sensor
	The camera or sensor could be used to stick other players to the ground because the bounds were not checked properly when a thrown camera or sensor landed. Now the camera or sensor simply explodes (dealing no damage) instead of sticking a player to the ground. -Randomer

- Spy Feign/Unfeign
	You were warned that you could not feign on top of another spy, but were still allowed to.
	You could not unfeign and are warned that you can't unfeign when someone is standing on top of you when another player was within 64 game units from you but the other player did not have to actually be on top of you. You can now no longer feign while on top of another feigned spy (can still feign on top of any non-feigned player) and can unfeign unless another player is actually on top of you. -Randomer

- Sniper Rifle Power Up Time
	The sniper rifle power up time was based on the player's FPS, which allowed players with a greater FPS to do damage faster. The rifle now takes exactly 3.8 seconds to power up which matches the original TF code running at 30 FPS, as intended. -Randomer

- Newlines in Messages
	Some messages contain extra newlines in the middle of them. At least some of these newlines have been removed. -Randomer

	String errors (help me add to the list) -Pulseczar
		- "wastes his life hacking a \n.."

- Invulnerability (Pentagram & Respawn Guard)
	Some attacks could still affect players with invulnerability, particularly the player's armor. These have been fixed as follows. When a player is invulnerable: -Randomer
		- Concussion grenades no longer concuss them.
		- Krac grenades no longer strip their armor and cells.
		- EMP grenades no longer explode their ammo.
		- The impulse rifle no longer strips their armor.
		- Caltrops no longer slow them down.
		- Sniper rifle leg shots no longer slow them down.
		- The incendiary cannon, flame thrower and napalm grenades no longer set them on fire.
		- They can no longer be disarmed or have their arms broken with Judoka.
		- They can no longer be hooked onto with the grappling hook.
		- Antigrav Grenade -Pulseczar
		- Warlock can no longer spawn meat when backstabbing - RJ

- Grappling Hook
	The player used to slowly slide to the floor when building or hacking while on the hook. This has been fixed, which could pose a small problem if they are in the middle of the air when they build or hack. -Randomer

- Assault Cannon
	Removed console spam when trying to fire assault cannon while in the air -Pulseczar/Randomer
		- Used .goal_state to hold time value to prevent the spam -I think I used randomer's code when merging -RJ

- Mines
	Supernailgun and laser cannon can now blow up mines -Pulseczar

- Judo
	Judo gives back weapon, but not ammo.. why?? (I think it's because I've been discarding while judoed) -Pulseczar
		- Took out old fix - going to try to fix discard so that it doesn't discard judoed weapon ammo
		- Also, apparently you can't use a weapon you judo from someone if you discard, but that makes sense, right? you would discard the ammo for the weapon, then judo the weapon and not have the ammo to use it
		- Implemented something - not sure if it fixed this bug


========================================================================
Changes/Balance:
========================================================================

- Fix bunny hopping
		-Fixed in FTE server

- Light Assault Gun
	The light assault gun has been changed to use shells rather than nails -- shells are usually zero-fly-time (instant hit when you fire them) while nails are usually projectiles and take some amount of time to reach the enemy. It has also been given 1/4th the spread that the assault cannon has. -Randomer

	Tone down light assault slightly -Pulseczar
		- Weapons.qc / FireBullets()
		- Damage should be decreased by 25%

- Voting System
	The voting system has been improved greatly. -Randomer
		- If more than 50% of the people on the server vote yes then a vote will pass immediately.
		- If more than 50% of the people on the server vote no then a vote will fail immediately.
		- If after 60 seconds if more people have voted yes than no then the vote passes, otherwise it fails.

- Krac Grenades
	Krac grenades have been given linear falloff damage for armor, cells and buildings and the range against these has been increased slightly to compensate for this large decrease in damage. The damage may need to be adjusted some, especially against buildings, to balance it more. -Randomer

	Pulseczar:
	- Now subtracts armor by 90 and cells by 100 (changed to 75 on armor and 90 on cells)
	- Rather than instant cut down to 10 armor (or 75 armor with impact armor)
	- Should this be toned down even more? Considering how easy it is to hit with kracs (very little timing involved)
	- And does 25% less damage to builds than before (another value that needs lots of testing)

- Concussion Grenades
	The TF2.9 style uncheatable "stumble" concussion grenades have been added. The server can select the old style grenades with localinfo old_grens "1". -Randomer

	Shorten conc time (old: 25sec ; new: 12.5) -Pulseczar
		- Changed #define GR_CONCUSS_TIME from 5 to 2.5, changing conc time from 25 to 12.5 seconds

	When the "no_conc" key is "on", disable conc grens -phrosty

- Psi Grenades
	Decrease psi area-effect and time of effect -Pulseczar
		- Time: 4.5 down to 3.5 (time of psi mines not affected)
		- Radius: 250 down to 200
	When the "no_psi" key is "on", disable psi grens -phrosty

- Napalm Grenades
	- #define NAPALM_MINDMG 40 // PZ - was 60
	- #define NAPALM_MAXDMG 80 // PZ - was 120
	- #define NAPALM_MAINDMG 100 // PZ - was 140
	- These all have to do with the damage over time.. the initial damage was kept the same.

- Grenades
	- the "no_spam" key now includes more grenades plus c4 detpack when the key is "on". -RJ

- Airfist
	The regular detpack is now unfistable. The C4 detpack is now unfistable for the first half second to reduce detpack spamming, and the velocity that the c4 detpack gets when fisted is now reduced by half. -Randomer

	Players with Aspect of HWGuy can now only be pushed one quarter the amount that players without Aspect of HWGuy can be pushed. Recoil from firing the airfist has been reduced by 30% for players with Aspect of HWGuy. -Randomer

	Make dets un-fistable (no fisted dets at last second - too hard for engies to defend against). -Pulseczar
		- Only regular dets are un-fistable.. and fist does half the force to tossable dets.

	Reduced airfist recoil for players who are holding the flag (if "no_fisting_noobs" key is "on") -phrosty

- Sniper Rifle
	Make sniper rifle and autorifle weak to builds (too easy to take out builds with sniper) -Pulseczar
		- Added check for builds under W_FireSniperRifle()
		- Currently at 25% of the damage of before (still looking for a sweet spot value)

	Increase range of sniper rifle
			- Now should be the same range as spray rifle

	If you are a theif, looking down the scope reveals you -phrosty

	Added model geometry (somewhat) checking to sniper rifle fire and sniper dot. You can now aim between players legs and over their shoulders and not gib them, but it's not too accurate. REQUIRES FTE or any QW engine supporting DP_QC_TRACE_OVETYPE_HITMODEL - avirox

- Incendiary Cannon & Napalm Grenades
	Fire from the incendiary cannon and napalm grenades no longer go through walls. -Randomer

	Pulseczar:
	- Lowered #FLAME_MAXPLYRFLAMES from 4 to 3
	- Don't really have a clue yet how that will affect it; hopefully will decrease damage by 25%?
	- Now seems about like the classic flamethrower - too weak for people to bother with

- Martyr (much thanks to randomer for all his help fixing bugs with this) -Pulseczar
	- Martyr no longer has invulnerability; has an insta-det C-4 vest
	- Damage is directly tied to radius in detpack functioning
	- Setting damage/radius to 41.65% of det
	- Constructed a new JobMartyr() and C-4VestExplode function out of old JobMartyr() and 3 detpack functions
	- Shouldn't survive in any way (including invulnerability)
	- Just made it so you can't det while invulnerable for now (also, martyr is guarenteed not to survive det)
	- Need to remove some things that aren't needed like showing detpack model (general cleanup of new functions)
	- Detpack map triggers should be working too
	- Just remember the C-4 vest has less range than the detpack
	- The sound of the detpack might need to be toned down too once its damage is decided
	- No longer can be heard all over the map (ATTN_NONE to ATTN_NORM)
	- Though the player always died in the test, sometimes they weren't gibbed (minor bug)
	- Should be fixed
	- C-4 vest explodes say %5 of the time it gets hit by explosive damage? (Lith)
	- How about emp has a chance to cause vest trigger to malfunction, causing the vest to explode at a random time (how about between 5 and 30 seconds?) (emps add a lot of time to det timer)
	- Or krac has a chance of making vest explode (kracs destroy dets)
	- Or how about kracs giving chance of making vest malfunction in some way like destroying the vest and making the electronics of the bomb "burn a hole through the martyr's chest"
	- Add a 'Glory to God!' sound? (done)
	- "God decrees that ye shall not commit suicide more than once per minute"? (done)

- Builds
	Give builds more health -Pulseczar
		- Added +50% to initial health (the health the building starts with) amount in defs.qc (had to edit other file(s) too for sent and tes upgrades)
		- Why do cameras seem indestructable now? (at least against martyr)

	Add confimation menus for dismantle/destroy (no more accidently hitting dismantle, FFS) -Pulseczar
		- Need a menu that 'intercepts' the call to dismantle build and passes on the call if player confirms else it cancels call
		- Seems to all be working.. much thanks to randomer.

	Turreted teslas now accessible via dispencer -avirox
		- Currently only accesses one tesla though

	Tinker.qc moved into tesla.qc

- Summons
	Shouldn't be able to infect summons.. too easy to kill them that way -Pulseczar
		- Disabled, should be fixed
	Summons no longer fistable, except scrag -p4wn/RJ

- Lightning Gun
	Re-enabled the 'push' (via the #define in ofndefs) :P -RJ

- MegaTF
	Removed the 'lay' lameness by the megatf haters -RJ
	Updated the curse server to an Amnesia megatf server address in the source (theres a key for it as well that most probably don't even know about)
	Added mtf rocket speed (900 -> 1350)
	Grenades now sound megatfish, players can hear others prime 'nade
	Added mtf foorsteps, enable with the footsteps key

- Prematch
	Now permits reloading and grenades (hey, why not?) -RJ

- Classes
	Civilian
		Now has respawn gaurd -p4wn

- Obituaries: Updated some of the death messages - p4wn

- Menus: Fixed a small bug when using some of the spectator menu options, it just visually displayed the wrong menu (functionally fine though) -RJ

========================================================================
Known Issues:
========================================================================

- Judoka & Primed Grenades
	After having your weapon stolen by a player with Judoka, you cannot throw a primed grenade. Since the grenade explodes 3.8 seconds after you prime and Judoka disables you for 5 seconds you will always be holding the primed grenade when it explodes.


----------------------Ideas/Suggested fixes-----------------------------
+++++++++++
===fixes===
+++++++++++

_. instead of "no room to build here" jive, make it put the build as close to the wall as it can

_. remove delay when you join server that keeps you from joining team and choosing class for a few seconds?

_. damage over time things and invulnerability (fire, disease, etc. shouldn't last through pent)

_. people feigned in acid don't take damage from acid (might just be that way in shallow acid - not sure)

_. berzerker doesn't damage invulnerable people

_. mines can be killed by explosions on the other side of walls?

_. gives frags for dismantling enemy fields? but not for destroying them
	-also, player loses frag when dies to iced field dismantle, and owner gets no frag (seems wrong)

_. teammates turreting friendly builds or turning sents?

_. sliding down while hacking on grapple (bug) (PZ - didn't rando fix this?)
	-I've worked quite a bit on this one before to no avail
	-also noticed that if you hold jump while grappled to ceiling, you'll slide down (could be related)

_. disable underwater teslas, since they don't make sense?
	-or maybe make them do some sort of weaker radius damage when underwater
	 -and in some fashion that doesn't destroy/disable the tesla
	-or make it so that when tesla fires underwater, it explodes and does a shitload of damage to anyone
	 anywhere near close to it in the water, like the lightning gun, and have amp, volts, and power affect it
	 the same way it normally would

_. casting auras is very hard in crowds (rl3001)
	-improved casting targetter?

_. "Also, I want that stupid bug fixed where you can't throw an already primed grenade when someone judos you." (randomer)

_. judoing back your own weapon causes you to lose it
	-and gives enemy a free weapon that he keeps until he re-classes
	-or something like that

_. vote system sometimes shows more votes required than what truly is
	-also does weird mess like requiring 3 out of 2 people's votes to kick someone

_. sometimes if you drop the flag with 'dropitems' it becomes invisible?

_. "Killing Machine" shows incorrectly a lot

_. spec scanner/id is not working in FTE server

-.	Builds also sometimes lock-on targets very slowly.. maybe up for the lock-on rate? -Pulseczar
		- I think it's just slow in large games.. quick in small games.. so if I increase lock-on rate time, might make builds overpowered in small games.. I wonder if there's a way to make lock-on not so laggy in large games.. would be nice if you could give more priority to some entities' thinks over others'.

### especially need people's input on these - just ideas right now ###

_. make sentries as customizable as teslas?
	-mmmm.. flamethrower sent... (when target is close enough, it fires flame)
	-Drakis's mobile sent?

_. stop krac through walls? conc through walls?

_. make it so that grapples don't keep flying (until they hit something) after the shoot button is released?

_. make aspect resist push from fist a lot more or completely?

_. add changeteam and changeclass commands?

_. nerf judo? (randomer)
	-can't be holding a weapon or primed nade while judoing
	 -create a 'non-existing' weapon that you get with judo (lol), that you have to be 'using' when you want to judo
	  -or just make the person use the axe?
	   -or make a new weapon that replaces judoer's axe, like fists?

_. nerf OTR? (randomer)
	-make it so that OTR only increases damage on enemies with kev
	 -where OTR functions as some sort of armor-piercing device

_. someone to finish Gremlin (says DP) http://www.customtf.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=199
	-Gremlin just has lots of bugs?
	 -Gremlin sometimes kills his owner or teammates
	 -player keeps weapon when Gremlin steals
	 -should Gremlin do some damage when he steals your weapon?
	 -"The gremlin can steal a laser cannon, but cannot fire it, so it only gets stolen for a fraction of a second."
	 -"When the gremlin steals te grenade launcher, he can't fire grenades, or attack any other way, so
	   he is useless when it happens."
	 -"The gremlin retains the physics of the regular quake monsters. This means when he lands on
	   something that isn't solid floor, he gets stuck for a sec."
	 -Gremlin keeps weapon after player dies
	 -Gremlin moves very slowly (like in slow-motion)
	 -Gremlin will jump in the water really easily (and the void?)
	 -"There is a strange bug where the gremlin removes all of your hp, you are unable to do anything but
	   fire (you are technically dead), but the enemy can still actually kill you, and you can kill yourself
	   with grenades or weapons."
	 -"He also has a weird jumping bug, where he doesn't attack, he only jumps at you. He is useless at this time."

_. is warlock finished? do heads function like they should?
	-lol. if vore is put in.. here's a use for heads.. make vore throw them instead of that purple thing
	 -make the heads function about the same as the purple thing
	  -make heads face whatever direction they are flying like Doom lost souls
	   -how could the warlock heads tie into the vore throwing heads? anyone? ammo for vore? damage heads do?
	-scrag and pirahna can't move up and down (rl3001)
	 -I believe I've seen scrags move up and down
	-shambler can't come to me on simple and wide easy ramp. (rl3001)
	-summons should be immune to medikit and disease. They're not of this world, you know. (rl3001)
	-give warlocks back meat if summon bugs (rl3001)

_. airfists.. a lot of people have problems with them (as in they are overpowered)
	-what do you think?
	-it needs reloads IE air canisters. and put in really small splash damage? (rl3001)

_. kevlar
	-should it protect the head?
	-should snipers be able to wear it?

_. make flamethrower also do less damage to builds?

_. should chap radius be limited to line-of-sight? (rl3001)

_. AGR vote option
   (hmm, who might have it been that suggested this? I just can't remember...)
	-should be simple to implement
	 -remove red's flag or something
	-blue team needs to get something out of defending (X frags for successfully defending for Y minutes)

_. should body explosion vary explosive power, depending upon how much explosive ammo you are carrying? (Drakis)

_. should airfist not move enemy disguised spies? (Melkor)
	-this is so that spies aren't so easy to detect

_. allow spectators to 'manifest' like ghosts? where they become visible in free-cam mode as a disembodied head? (Drakis)

_. add a centerprint progression bar for hacking time? (The Twix King)

_. be able to pick up pieces of buildings to use for metal or something? (like warlock and gibs) (Drakis)

_. make a minimum number of players in game to enable capping (like, six? adjustable var)
	-make it depend on map config (smaller maps should probably require less people to cap)

_. add vote to extend timelimit and/or fraglimit on the current map

_. remove 'user' names
	-if one joins with (or switches their name to) the name 'unnamed', 'player', or 'user-####', they are told
	 to change their name to anything else, and kicked

_. how about making a command in the game that "says" your health and armor to everyone rather than making it
   client-based? (major major major major)
	-Mega has %A = returns armor and %H = returns health, for example

_. what about making the sniper dot sprite a flat model instead so that it can be shown flat up against the wall,
   rather than always facing the viewer as all sprites do? would a model of 1 unit thickness look right?
   is it possible to make a model of 0 thickness, that's basically a sprite but doesn't function like one? (can
   be made to face one direction)

_. use infokey(entity, key) to align spectator's FOV with sniper they are specing?

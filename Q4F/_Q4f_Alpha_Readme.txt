This distribution is the source code for the public
alpha release of Quake 4 Fortress. The code is being
released for the purpose of being useful to other
Quake 4 mod developers and future developers of
Fortress-based games. Feel free to use whatever
you can, all I ask is for a little credit if
you use any of Q4F's code.

If you have any questions regarding the code, you
can email 3j at:

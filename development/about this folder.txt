This folder contains individual developers' code, as well as different types of code we are working off of.
Feel free to look through it and make a copy onto your own pc if you like (to edit or whatever) but please
DO NOT modify its contents. This applies to developers as well, if the code is not your project. We wish
to keep our code intact and would rather not have the hassle of rolling back our SVN projects alot. You
may do what you feel like to any code you copy onto your pc, but please keep previous names and handles in
it for recodnition if you plan to release it. Thanks for reading this,

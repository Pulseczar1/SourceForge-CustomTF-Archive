Well here's the deal -- 
 Apparently FrikQCC hates my mod. The only way to compile with it is to replace the defs.pqc with the
one in this folder, which may mess up strcat (I've only tried it in FTE Server so far). However, some
servers may find a mod compiled with frik more "agreeable". I've cleaned up the code quite a bit, and
will try to work out a lot of those warnings in future releases. Unless you have compatability issues
though, I suggest using FTEQCCGUI. Peace,

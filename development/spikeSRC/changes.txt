first off, compiling with fteqcc:
	You need to use the -Fhashonly commandline option.
	This is needed to prevent autoexpansion of constants with the same name as fields.
	fteqcc has a more C-like precompiler, which doesn't require the # infront of constants. Pretty much everything else works the same.
	fteqcc is able to compile the mod into about 10k globals.

changes:
added fteqw.qc
	This file contains cpqwsv->fte extension mappings.
	It it changes the builtins to call fte builtins instead.
	It won't interfere with cpqwsv functions.

fixed buy menus
	fteqw cycles between 16 different temporary strings.
	cpqwsv cycles between 256 or so temporary strings.
	yeah, this is a big difference. however, fte's maximum string length is much longer, and upping the string count is not a nice memory efficient way to fix this.
	I have added pr_tempstringcount and pr_tempstringsize cvars, incase I missed something, but the defaults are the same.

corrected/added client download capabilities:
	the assumptions about which engines can use lit files is a little... well, wrong. I've added a force postfix for future issues.
	I've also added support for .lux and .rtlights which only fteglqw can use currently. force works here too, of course.
